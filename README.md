# Jewish AI Projects

A curated list of projects exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and Jewish religious life.

## About This Resource

This resource list gathers together projects and tools that explore how artificial intelligence can be leveraged to support various facets of Jewish religious life.

This is a nascent technology area. Much as AI is beginning to have effects across wide ranges of industries and applications, so too are use cases being identified and explored for various facets of Jewish religious observance—ranging from Jewish textual analysis through to calendar utilities providing the Hebrew calendar and Shabbat times.
